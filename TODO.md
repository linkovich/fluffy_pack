CONSIDER ADDING:
- AI Improvements - if we need the performance
- Astikoor - animania may handle the carts, probably not needed
- Dynamic Trees - don't forget compat mods are separate
- Bibliocraft - probably not needed, would need a lot of config to remove some blocks and items
- BiomeTweakerCore - if we need more biome options
- Broken Wings - if we need to remove flight in certain dimensions, like maybe the later abyssalcraft ones
- Buildcraft - really only if we need another pipe option, none of the other machines appeal to me
- Caliper - when we need to optimize the pack
- Catwalks 4 - looks nice, just lower priority for now
- Clef - just a fun mod, low priority
- Clumps - performance
- Cooking for Blockheads - if we can remove the kitchen stuff or gate/require power/water for it to work
- Cyclic - a select few blocks and items are useful, but would need to be heavily configured
- Dark Utilities - same as above
- Dark Roleplay Medieval - probably don't need the deco blocks here
- Defiled Lands - would need to be heavily configured and rare
- Diet Hoppers - if for some reason we choose to keep vanilla hoppers
- Doomlike Dungeons - if we need more adventure worldgen
- BattleTowers - if we need more adventure worldgen

- Earthworks - low priority, would need some recipe changes
- Environmental Tech + ET Lunar - possible tech mod to add, not sure about it just yet, will need testing
- Extra Golems - we'd probably only want to keep 1 or 2, would need to test and configure
- Twilight Forest - Just not sure about this one atm. I feel like it needs a quality bump and to maybe be a complete mod before we include this
- Farming for Blockheads - if Harvestcraft's stores don't do what we need it to
- Felling - interesting enchant option
- Ferdinand's Flowers - very good looking, but low priority and will need a lot of recipe removal to get excess blocks out
- Forestry - could be cool, but would need major tweaking and needs testing in general
- Garden Stuff - more deco options that would need recipe tweaking
- Hunting Dimension - might just be an interesting one, would need to tweak recipes
- Immersive Craft - don't need the rock or stick worldgen, but some extra early game blocks might be nice
- Inspirations - would need heavy configuration, low priority, deco
- Railcraft - not updated for 1.12 yet
- Jurrasicraft - could be an interesting late game side-game
- Aquaculture - if fishing could be better
- More water mods in general - the ocean could be more interesting
- Landlust Furniture - another deco mod option, probably not needed
- Magneticraft - would need to strip out only the multiblocks we want and adjust their recipes
- Millenaire - probably not our style, and would take major balancing changes
- Minecolonies - probably not our style, and would take major balancing changes
- Mob Dismemberment - that gore though
- Mystic World - some more passive mob options, low priority, would need config

- Animalium - more dangerous wildlife, low priority
- Pickle Tweaks - literally the only thing we want is the mesh for the easy gravel recipe
- Primitive Mobs - a few more interesting mobs, and a few we'd need to disable
- Reliquary - if we need more magic stuff to fill in gaps, will need to research
- Roots - if we need more magic stuff to fill in gaps, will need to research
- Rustic - would have to disable quite a few overlapping features, but has great deco options, and a cool alchemy side-game
- Road Runner - if we need to change a few blocks movement speed modifiers
- Set Effect - if we need to add some effects to armor sets
- Ordinary Coins - is interesting, possibly make a press mold for the metal press ?
- Clothesline - mod to watch, could be interesting deco addition atm
- The Erebus - another dimension for potential exploration, but would need heavy config
- Natural Pledge - Looks pretty cool, definitely a possible inclusion, extends Botania a bit
- Water Control Extreme - May need to adjust water
- Tumbleweed - just a little more ambience
- Vampirism - might be a cool addition to the magic tree, but would need balancing and research
