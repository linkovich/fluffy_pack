- Start looking at magneticraft to fill some tech gaps in the early / mid-late game
- Disable colored bricks, adobe from better with addons
- Adjust obsidian boat recipe from netherex, or remove entirely
- Grimoire of Gaia - Achievement - Finish the Grimoire of Gaia
  - Make the grimoire an actual book that is used to summon mobs from the book (other then a select few we'll let spawn under other circumstances). By default the book would contain pictures of land and question marks and faded images of monsters. If you flip to that page, and use the book on the terrain as described, it'll summon the respective mob. Killing that mob would fill in the image and name of the mob. To get the achievement you'd have to finish the book by summoning and killing all the mobs within.

- In world chopping block should give 3
- Remove horse power manual grindstone, add all those recipes to stone mortar
- Embers structure spawnrate might be a tad high
- Basketcase baskets need to be able to use ANY cordage (possibly need to oredict primal cordage)
- Alternate recipes for BwM wicker (?)

- Stellar Sky - incompabitible with thaumcraft and astral sorcery and bloodmoon currently

CONSIDER ADDING:
- AI Improvements - if we need the performance
- Dynamic Trees - don't forget compat mods are separate
- Bibliocraft - probably not needed, would need a lot of config to remove some blocks and items
- BiomeTweakerCore - if we need more biome options
- Buildcraft - really only if we need another pipe option, none of the other machines appeal to me
- Caliper - when we need to optimize the pack
- Clef - just a fun mod, low priority
- Clumps - performance
- Cooking for Blockheads - would be great if we could require power/water for it to work
- Cyclic - a select few blocks and items are useful, but would need to be heavily configured
- Dark Utilities - same as above
- Dark Roleplay Medieval - probably don't need the deco blocks here
- Defiled Lands - would need to be heavily configured and rare
- Diet Hoppers - if for some reason we choose to keep vanilla hoppers
- Doomlike Dungeons - if we need more adventure worldgen
- BattleTowers - if we need more adventure worldgen
- Drones - if we can gate it behind reaching a certain tech-level
- Earthworks - low priority, would need some recipe changes
- Environmental Tech + ET Lunar - possible tech mod to add, not sure about it just yet, will need testing
- Extra Golems - we'd probably only want to keep 1 or 2, would need to test and configure
- Twilight Forest - Just not sure about this one atm. I feel like it needs a quality bump and to maybe be a complete mod before we include this
- Farming for Blockheads - if Harvestcraft's stores don't do what we need it to
- Felling - interesting enchant option
- Ferdinand's Flowers - very good looking, but low priority and will need a lot of recipe removal to get excess blocks out
- Forestry - could be cool, but would need major tweaking and needs testing in general
- Garden Stuff - more deco options that would need recipe tweaking
- Hunting Dimension - might just be an interesting one, would need to tweak recipes
- Immersive Craft - don't need the rock or stick worldgen, but some extra early game blocks might be nice
- Inspirations - would need heavy configuration, low priority, deco
- Railcraft - not updated for 1.12 yet
- Jurrasicraft - could be an interesting late game side-game
- Aquaculture - if fishing could be better
- More water mods in general - the ocean could be more interesting
- Landlust Furniture - another deco mod option, probably not needed
- Magneticraft - would need to strip out only the multiblocks we want and adjust their recipes
- Millenaire - probably not our style, and would take major balancing changes
- Minecolonies - probably not our style, and would take major balancing changes
- Mob Dismemberment - that gore though
- Mystic World - some more passive mob options, low priority, would need config
- Natura - mainly just for more door options and imps, we don't really want their trees to generate without heavy config, very low priority
- Animalium - more dangerous wildlife, low priority
- Pickle Tweaks - literally the only thing we want is the mesh for the easy gravel recipe
- Primitive Mobs - a few more interesting mobs, and a few we'd need to disable
- Reliquary - if we need more magic stuff to fill in gaps, will need to research
- Roots - if we need more magic stuff to fill in gaps, will need to research
- Rustic - would have to disable quite a few overlapping features, but has great deco options, and a cool alchemy side-game
- Road Runner - if we need to change a few blocks movement speed modifiers
- Set Effect - if we need to add some effects to armor sets
- Ordinary Coins - is interesting, possibly make a press mold for the metal press ?
- Clothesline - mod to watch, could be interesting deco addition atm
- The Erebus - another dimension for potential exploration, but would need heavy config
- Natural Pledge - Looks pretty cool, definitely a possible inclusion, extends Botania a bit
- Water Control Extreme - May need to adjust water
- Tumbleweed - just a little more ambience
- Vampirism - might be a cool addition to the magic tree, but would need balancing and research
- Wild Crops - probably not needed with harvestcraft gardens
- Electroblob's Wizardry - another interesting spell mod
- XNet and Ynot - interesting endgame tech
- Zombie Awareness - moar difficulty
- Worley's Caves - better cave generation
- Floocraft - adds a floo powder system with multiblock fireplaces, seems like a cool little magic tree addition
- Industrial Foregoing - might be a good tech mod to spend all that energy on
- Integrated Dynamics - might be worth a look
- Openblocks Elevator - actually a lot more balanced then I thought originally and looks like it provides a cool tech-y feel
- JAOPCA - might provide more compat between our mods that add ore
- Immersive Railroading - more interesting mid/late game tech geared towards travel
- The One Probe - maybe we use a very basic waila until the one probe is available ?
